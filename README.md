# WebSiteFlightAgency - CloudJet Project

## Flight Reservation System
This project is a flight reservation system that allows users to search and book flights easily and efficiently. The application was developed using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL, and includes features for user authentication, flight searching, and reservation management.

## Features

- **Flight Search:** Users can search for available flights based on different criteria.
- **Flight Reservations:** Ability to book flights directly through the platform.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Responsive design that enhances user experience.
- **User Authentication:** User registration and login to manage reservations.

## Database Structure

The database structure contains the following tables(Translated from Portuguese):
- **Users**
- **Flights**
- **Prices**
- **Destinations**

> **Note:** The database name was incorrectly configured as **cinema** due to an initial management error. It is recommended to change it to a more appropriate name, such as **flight_agency**, to better reflect the functionality of the system.

## Technologies Used

- **CSS:** Styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** Interactivity in the user interface.
